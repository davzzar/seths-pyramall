As up to four aliens crashland on earth they follow some archeologists into a pyramid. By accident one of the aliens triggers a switch. Now the sand starts to rise and there is only one way out: through the item shop on top. Show off your platforming skills while you reach for the top and mess with your friends as you put obstacles in their way.
