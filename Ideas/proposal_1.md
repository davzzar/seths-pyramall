############ Proposal 1
1. Temple Jump / Ascent to Heavens
1. 2D Game / Possible 2.5D background
1. Babylon Tower, running to the top.
1. Sand rising up, character can use sand to create additional platforms for use.
1. Players can bind others together. Different characters with different roles
Possible problems:
1. Need to define what are the technical achievements. Possible answers:
  1. Sand physics - Need to show how/ why this is hard. Hard to defend in my opinion
  1. AI NPCs - This can be as complex/ as simple as we want. We can always make the argument that custom networks/training was needed. Generative algorithms are also useful.
  1. Level autogeneration - We can explain how the levels are generated and pre-tested to be doable before they are used in the game.
