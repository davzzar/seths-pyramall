1. Tom & Jerry: Castle building / The Damn Beach / Beachy Beach / Beach Me Baby
1. 3D Game
1. The whole game revolves around the simulation of sand. More specifically, the player must use sand to build a castle that sustains larger and larger waves from the sea.
1. The castle has a strict definition of being "still standing". This can be defined as having a place on it, which has not been yet touched by water.
Possible problems:
1. Need to define what are the technical achievements. Possible answers:
  1. Sand simulation - The game is simple enough so that we can devote the whole time to building the most optimised/beautiful sand and water engine. This is only one feature, but the lecturers repeatedly said doing one thing right is more useful than doing 2 things half-right, so we can make it as beautiful as we want.
  1. Tom vs Jerry competition - The castle generated by the player can be tested at the same time as a castle generated by a generative algorithm. This autogeneration can be quite complex, especially if stones are added to the terrain which would protect parts of the castle. In the game, the player plays Jerry, while Tom is an AI.
