############ Proposal 2
1. Uber the Uber Drivers / Transport Me / I Don't Need your Tip / Tip Me If You Can
1. 3D Game / 2D top-down
1. Taxi driver lives in a city where every day the traffic rules are different. Those can include minimum and maximum speed limits, different interpretations of the lights, requirements for side quests like hitting pedestrians, requirements to leave the passenger in a different position than the one requested, requirement to kill the passenger before the destination
1. Sand is used to make the drifting easier / The game may take place in Cairo which is sandy
Possible problems:
1. Need to define what are the technical achievements. Possible answers:
  1. Rule generation - The way the rules for each day are generated can be complex, therefore technically challenging.
  1. Rule satisfiability testing - The generated rules must be able to be satisfied by the driver, therefore this check can also be very complex depending on the rules
  1. Rule abidement checking - The driver must follow the rules, which can also be hard to check
